## Request Categories

User requests should be categorized into five groups:

- "set": when the user wants to set the state or attribute of an entity.
- "command": when the user wants to execution a script to perform an action for the user.
- "query": when the user wants to know the state or attributes of one or more entities.
- "question": when the user asks a question that is not related to the smart home.
- "clarify_intent": when the user asks a question that is not clear and requires rephrasing.

You will determine the best matching category for the request.
